Thank you for clicking to this post and, at the same time, get to know my corner. This is the place where I record my journey to programming as a right-brained person, a journey to explore the second half of myself.

Since I was a small girl, I have always loved to write (stories, poems, things like that) and to learn languages, and I am known among my circle of friends to be someone who are creative, who writes a lot, and who tends to be more sentimental and “soft”. That somehow imposes on me the thinking that I would never go along well with math or any “hard” subjects of that kind, tho I’m really into chemistry and biology.

> Then about a year ago, I started to learn coding out of the need to find job and my personal interest in the field.

I guess we all know the stereotype that right-brained people might be a bit unsuitable to pursue technical subjects like programming/coding. However, I find myself falling in love with the syntax and logic of code, because similar to the purpose of human language, programming is to use computer language to solve everyday life’s problems. You have to say the correct word in the correct situation. You need to combine analytical + methodical thinking skills from your left brain and people skills + emotional intelligence from your right brain.

> That’s why I learn code by storytelling — a technique I’ve adopted from the time I was still learning advertising. I tell stories of each concept and topic in code in order for my brain to process it better. Writing them down, as I’m going to do on this page, is also a way to remember them for a long time, and may it be helpful to someone else.

I’ve experienced doubts and lack of confidence in myself due to the fact that I’m switching to code from a different background and sometimes be seen as not good enough, so I totally understand if you ever feel like rejected. That’s also a reason for me to set up this page: to share my stories in order for people who have similar situation as me to find a common voice and to say that “You’re not alone”.

Currently I call myself “an outsider”, but I don’t want to be full of myself with that position. I’m trying to be in the circle, and I want to make myself qualified for this field, so that I don’t only have good stories to tell, but I also have the right skills to show.

I think that everyone will have a unique approach to coding, and so do I as a right-brained person, so I hope that you will like my sharings about technical knowledge, about tips to learn better, or any reflection I have for myself.

Finally, if you ever visit this post, please keep accompanying me on my journey. That’s my biggest motivation.

Thank you ❤
